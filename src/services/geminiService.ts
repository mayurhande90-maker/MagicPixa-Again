You will receive an uploaded image. First, perform a detailed visual analysis of this photo before generating any caption or hashtags.

Analyze the following:
1. Main subject(s) ‚Äî what or who is in the photo.
2. Objects, background, environment, and setting.
3. Any visible text or product logos.
4. Emotions, color palette, and lighting tone.
5. Overall theme ‚Äî for example: travel, tech, fashion, food, podcast, fitness, education, event, nature, etc.
6. Scene composition ‚Äî indoor, outdoor, studio, natural light, crowd, etc.

After the visual analysis:
- First, write one **Recommended Caption**. This should be the single best, most engaging caption for the image, complete with 3-5 of the most important hashtags integrated naturally at the end. It should be instantly postable.
- Then, write **3 separate caption options** (Short, Medium, Long).
  - The short caption should be punchy and expressive (ideal for Reels or YouTube Shorts).
  - The medium caption should tell a short story or context (Instagram posts).
  - The long caption should include context + a strong CTA line (LinkedIn or Facebook).

- Finally, generate a separate list of **hashtags** that are:
  - 100% relevant to what‚Äôs visible in the photo.
  - Trending, clean, and ad-safe.
  - Include both broad and niche tags.
  - Format hashtags clearly ‚Äî separated by spaces, with line breaks if needed.

- Maintain a professional layout and readability:
  - Add line breaks, spacing, and emojis only where contextually natural.
  - **CRITICAL:** Captions MUST be written in simple, conversational, everyday English. They must sound completely natural and human. Avoid complex vocabulary or robotic phrasing.
  - Avoid generic filler lines like ‚ÄúA beautiful day!‚Äù unless contextually correct.

Output must be **ready to post** directly on platforms like Instagram, YouTube Community, or Facebook.

-----------------------------------------
FORMAT THE OUTPUT EXACTLY LIKE THIS:
-----------------------------------------

‚öôÔ∏è **Auto Notes:**
<one-line explanation of what the image contains>

üåü **Recommended Caption:**
<The single best caption, ready to post, with 3-5 integrated hashtags>

---

ü™∂ **Caption (Short):**
<short caption text>

üí¨ **Caption (Medium):**
<medium caption text>

üìù **Caption (Long):**
<long caption text>

üè∑Ô∏è **Hashtags (Recommended):**
#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5 #hashtag6 ...

-----------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------
- The top priority is that captions sound authentic and human. Use simple language that people use in their daily lives.
- If the image contains a person, describe the vibe or emotion ‚Äî never identify who they are.
- If it‚Äôs a product or object, mention features or purpose naturally.
- If it‚Äôs travel/nature ‚Äî highlight place, vibe, and mood.
- If text is detected on image, use that to understand theme (e.g., ‚ÄúPodcast‚Äù or ‚ÄúFull Episode‚Äù).
- Use relevant emojis only when it fits the tone.
- Do not overuse hashtags (15‚Äì20 max).
- Do not include any banned or misleading hashtags.
- The final output should look balanced and properly spaced for direct posting.

-----------------------------------------
NEGATIVE PROMPT
-----------------------------------------
"Do not produce captions unrelated to the image.
Do not invent objects or events.
Do not include any names of people.
Do not generate hashtags that are irrelevant or spammy.
Avoid overused hashtags like #instagood or #photooftay unless contextually fitting.
Do not use repeated emojis or symbols excessively."`;

Use a base of neutral colors but introduce pops of bold, fashionable accent colors (e.g., mustard yellow, teal, coral) on feature walls or furniture. Furniture has curved lines and unique shapes. Mix materials like wood, metal, and plastic. Incorporate modern art, graphic patterns, and flexible, collaborative seating areas.',
    'Creative / Artistic': 'Create a Creative / Artistic office space that inspires innovation. This style is eclectic and unconventional. Use bold, contrasting colors and large-scale murals or graphic installations. Furniture can be experimental, quirky, and mismatched. Encourage collaboration with writeable walls, flexible layouts, and unique breakout zones. Decor is expressive, featuring local art, employee creations, and unusual objects. The lighting can be dramatic and varied.',
    'Biophilic / Nature-Inspired': 'Design a Biophilic office that connects occupants with nature. Maximize natural sunlight with large windows. Incorporate a large number of living plants, green walls, or indoor gardens. Use natural, earthy materials like light wood, bamboo, stone, and natural fibers (wool, cotton). The color palette is inspired by nature: greens, blues, and earthy browns. Furniture should have organic shapes. The goal is a calm, healthy, and stress-reducing environment.',
    'Traditional Indian': 'Infuse a Traditional Indian aesthetic into the office space. Use rich wooden textures, particularly teak or rosewood, for desks and cabinetry. Incorporate cultural touches like subtle jali (lattice work) in partitions, brass inlays on furniture, or traditional motifs in textiles for upholstery. The color palette should be warm and earthy, with tones of ochre, terracotta, and deep browns. Lighting can include elegant fixtures with brass or copper finishes. The overall feel should be professional yet culturally rooted and warm.',
    'Tech Futuristic': 'Generate a Tech Futuristic office interior. This style is sleek, innovative, and high-tech. Use glossy white or metallic surfaces, integrated LED strip lighting (often in blue or white), and glass walls that may feature interactive displays. Furniture is minimalist and modular, with ergonomic designs and integrated technology. The aesthetic is clean and almost clinical, with a color palette of white, silver, and black, accented by the glow from lighting and screens.'

ROOM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- ${specificInstruction}

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION:
- You MUST preserve the existing structural layout with absolute precision. This includes the exact position, size, and shape of all windows, doors, walls, and the original ceiling height.
- Do NOT alter the core architecture in any way.

PHOTOREALISM DIRECTIVES:
- SPATIAL ANALYSIS: Meticulously analyze the photo's perspective, depth, and scale. All new furniture and decor must be realistically proportioned to fit the room's dimensions and adhere to the established perspective. Avoid any spatial inconsistencies.
- LIGHTING & SHADOWS: Create natural, believable lighting based on the visible light sources (e.g., windows). All objects must cast soft, realistic shadows that ground them in the scene.
- TEXTURES & MATERIALS: Render all materials with high-fidelity textures. Wood should have grain, fabrics should have weaves, and surfaces should have subtle, realistic imperfections. Avoid flat, artificial, or "plastic-looking" surfaces.

DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS:
- Only change the furniture, wall color/treatment, flooring, lighting fixtures, and decorative elements.
- The desired style for this redesign is ${style}.`;
